### **What is a Data Scientist?**

- A Data Scientist works with data to deliver value to a business.
- Data Science can sometimes overlap with domains such as **Data Analysts**, **Data Engineers** and **DevOps**.
- How much the Data Scientists role overlaps with these other roles depends on the company.
- A Data Scientist is generally focused on modelling data to be able to predict an outcome accurately.
- Core skills Data Scientists use statistics, mathematics, programming and communication.

### Key roles and responsibilities of a **Data Scientist**

1. **Business understanding & problem framing:** What is the context of this problem and why are they trying to solve it? 
2. **Exploratory data analysis & cleaning:** What data are we working with, what does it look like, and how can we improve it?
3. **Feature engineering:** Can we enrich this dataset using our expertise or third-party information? 
4. **Modeling and evaluation:** Can we use this dataset to accurately make predictions? If so, are they reliable?
5. **Insights & Recommendations:** How to communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business?

### What is **feature engineering**?

- Feature engineering refers to the addition, deletion, combination, and mutation of your data set to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy.
- In the context of this task, feature engineering refers to the engineering of the data to create new columns that will help us predict more accurately.
- Effective feature engineering is based on domain knowledge of the business problem and the available data sources.
