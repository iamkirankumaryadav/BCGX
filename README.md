### **What is a Data Scientist?**

- A Data Scientist works with data to deliver value to a business.
- Data Science can sometimes overlap with domains such as **Data Analysts**, **Data Engineers** and **DevOps**.
- How much the Data Scientists role overlaps with these other roles depends on the company.
- A Data Scientist is generally focused on modelling data to be able to predict an outcome accurately.
- Core skills Data Scientists use statistics, mathematics, programming and communication.

### Key roles and responsibilities of a **Data Scientist**

1. **Business understanding & problem framing:** What is the context of this problem and why are they trying to solve it? 
2. **Exploratory data analysis & cleaning:** What data are we working with, what does it look like, and how can we improve it?
3. **Feature engineering:** Can we enrich this dataset using our expertise or third-party information? 
4. **Modeling and evaluation:** Can we use this dataset to accurately make predictions? If so, are they reliable?
5. **Insights & Recommendations:** How to communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business?

### What is **Exploratory Data Analysis**?

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a technique used by a Data Scientist to gain a holistic understanding of the data that they are working with.
- It is mainly based on using **statistical techniques** (such as descriptive statistics) and **visualizations** to gain a deeper understanding of the statistical properties that the data holds.

### What is **Feature Engineering**?

- Feature engineering refers to the addition, deletion, combination, and mutation of your data set to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy.
- In the context of this task, feature engineering refers to the engineering of the data to create new columns that will help us predict more accurately.
- Effective feature engineering is based on domain knowledge of the business problem and the available data sources.

### What is **Classification**?

- When you are trying to predict an outcome, the result that you’re trying to predict can either be:
- A continuous number, e.g. an employee salary or a discrete value, e.g. a job title
- In our example, we are trying to predict whether or not a client will churn, so it will only ever be 1 of 2 values (True/False, 1/0, etc…).
